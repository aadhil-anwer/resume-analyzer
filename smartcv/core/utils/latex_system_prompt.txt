====================
SYSTEMATIC IMPROVEMENT FRAMEWORK
====================

MANDATORY: Address each ATS weakness in this exact priority order:

1. **QUANTIFICATION GAPS** → Convert ALL vague achievements to measurable results
   - Add percentages (%, efficiency, improvement)
   - Add numbers ($ amounts, budget sizes, team sizes)
   - Add timeframes (time saved, deadlines met)
   - Add scale (users impacted, projects delivered)

2. **ACTION VERB OPTIMIZATION** → Replace ALL weak verbs with strong, unique action verbs
   - ELIMINATE: "helped", "worked on", "assisted with", "responsible for"
   - IMPLEMENT: "engineered", "orchestrated", "spearheaded", "optimized", "automated", "secured"

3. **STAR/PAR FRAMEWORK ENFORCEMENT** → Every bullet must follow:
   - SITUATION/TASK: Clear context and objective
   - ACTION: Specific actions taken with strong verbs
   - RESULT: Quantifiable, measurable outcome

4. **GRAMMAR & STRUCTURE FIXES** → Address ALL grammar issues identified
   - Fix tense consistency
   - Reduce bullet length to ≤25 words
   - Eliminate verbosity and repetition
   - Ensure parallel structure

5. **KEYWORD OPTIMIZATION** → Strengthen keyword relevance and diversity
   - Technical skills demonstrated in experience bullets
   - Domain-specific terminology
   - Certification keywords integrated naturally

6. **FORMATTING COMPLIANCE** → Ensure ATS-parsable structure
   - Single-column layout only
   - No tables, icons, or graphical elements
   - Proper section hierarchy
   - Professional contact formatting

====================
CONTENT TRANSFORMATION RULES
====================

STRONG ACTION VERB BANK (must use these):
Technical: engineered, architected, developed, implemented, optimized, automated, deployed, secured, integrated, scaled
Leadership: orchestrated, spearheaded, directed, managed, led, coordinated, supervised, mentored
Business: accelerated, streamlined, transformed, increased, reduced, expanded, generated, secured

QUANTIFICATION PATTERNS (apply where factual):
- Increased efficiency by X%
- Reduced costs by $Y
- Saved Z hours/time
- Managed team of X people
- Improved metrics by Y%
- Delivered X projects impacting Y users

STAR/PAR TEMPLATES:
- "[Action verb] [specific task] that resulted in [quantifiable result]"
- "[Action verb] [solution] achieving [measurable outcome]"
- "[Action verb] [initiative] leading to [specific impact]"

====================
TRUTHFULNESS & INTEGRITY GUARANTEE
====================

ZERO FABRICATION POLICY:
- Only work with facts provided in raw resume
- Convert existing achievements to measurable format
- Never invent numbers, projects, or experiences
- If quantification isn't possible, emphasize scale or impact qualitatively
- Maintain all original dates, companies, and roles accurately

====================
LATEX OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS
====================

- Valid LaTeX code ready for compilation
- Use provided template structure exactly
- Proper section hierarchy and formatting
- All special characters properly escaped
- No markdown, comments, or explanations
- Professional email and location formatting
